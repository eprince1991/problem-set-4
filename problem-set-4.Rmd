# Overview

Take the [datacamp course on joining data](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-r-with-dplyr) to learn the join verbs.

You will analyze some data in the [`nihexporter`](https://github.com/jayhesselberth/nihexporter) package to answer some questions. The questions will cover methods in `dplyr` including two-table verbs.

First you need to install the `nihexporter` package (and `devtools`, if you don't have it already).

```r
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("jayhesselberth/nihexporter")
```

Read the [Overview vignette](http://jayhesselberth.github.io/nihexporter/articles/nihexporter.html) to learn the structure of the pacakge. Take a look at two tables from the package:

```{r overview, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(nihexporter)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(cowplot)
library(gganimate)

projects
project_io
```

# Problems

## Problem 1

The `projects` and `project_io` tables have the `r intersect(names(projects), names(project_io))` column in common. Use this column to perform a `left_join` and identify the most expensive project for each institute. Project institutes are in the `projects` table, whereas total project costs are available in the `project_io` table. Note you will have to use the `arrange` and `slice` verbs from `dplyr`.

```{r problem_1}
projects %>% 
  left_join(project_io, 
            by = "project.num") %>% 
  arrange(desc(total.cost)) %>%
  select(project.num) %>%
  slice(1)
```

## Problem 2

Create a plot that describes the change in output (number of publications) for the most expensive grant from the above list. Note that you cannot use `n.pubs` for this, as that is an aggregate count over time. You need a tbl of following structure, which you can then use to calculate the number of publications each year (hint: use `n()` in a `summarize` statement:

```{r p2_tbl}
projects %>%
  head() %>%
  left_join(publinks, by ='project.num') %>%
  left_join(publications, by  = 'pmid') %>%
  select(project.num, fiscal.year, fy.cost, pmid) %>%
  na.omit()
```

```{r problem_2}

projects %>% 
  left_join(project_io, 
            by = "project.num") %>% 
  arrange(desc(total.cost)) %>%
  select(project.num) %>%
  slice(1) -> top.hit

projects %>%
  left_join(publinks, by = 'project.num') %>%
  left_join(publications, by = 'pmid') %>%
  select(project.num, pub.year, fy.cost, pmid) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  filter(project.num == as.character(top.hit)) %>%
  count(project.num, pub.year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(pub.year, n)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    theme_cowplot() +
    labs(title = paste0("Annual Publication Rates for ", top.hit),
         x = "Year",
         y = "Publications \n (Unique PMID Records per Year)")
```

## Problem 3

Use the `projects` and `clinical_studies` table to calculate how many clinical studies have been started by projects from each institute.

```{r problem_3}

projects %>% 
  inner_join(clinical_studies, 
             by = intersect(names(projects), names(clinical_studies))) -> tab 
  tab %>% 
    count(institute) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(institute, n)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
    labs(title = "NIH Clinical Studies per Institute", 
        x = "Institute", 
        y="NIH Clinical Studies Started") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 50, 
                                    hjust = 1, 
                                    vjust = 1, 
                                    size = rel(0.8)),
          axis.title.y = element_text(size = rel(0.8))) ->p3.plot.a

  tab %>% 
    count(institute, fiscal.year) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(fiscal.year, n, color = institute)) + 
    geom_point(aes(y=n)) + 
    theme_cowplot() + 
    labs(title = "Clinical Study Initiation by Institute", 
        x = "Fiscal Year", 
        y = "Clinical Studies Started", 
        color = "Institute") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = rel(0.8)),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = rel(0.8))) -> p3.plot.b
  
plot_grid(p3.plot.a, p3.plot.b, nrow = 2)


```

## Problem 4

Calculate correlations between `total.cost` and `n.pubs` for each institute. You will need to `join` the `projects` and `project_io` tables to link `institute` with `total.cost` and `n.pubs`. You will then need to use `group_by` and `do` from `dplyr` and `tidy` from `broom` to calculate correlations.

```{r problem_4}
projects %>% 
  left_join(project_io, by = "project.num") %>% 
  select(institute, n.pubs, total.cost) %>% 
  group_by(institute) %>% 
  do(tidy(cor(.$total.cost, .$n.pubs, use = "complete"))) %>%
  rename(total.cost_n.pubs_cor=x)
```

## Problem 5 (extra credit)

Correlate [`rcr`](https://icite.od.nih.gov/) values from the `publications` table to one of:

- total cost (overall for NIH, or by institute)
- budget mechanism (e.g., RFA, PAR, etc.)
- type of grant (e.g. R01, P01, R21, etc.). 

```{r extra_credit, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
publications %>% 
  inner_join(publinks, by = 'pmid') %>% 
  filter(rcr != 'NA') %>% 
  inner_join(projects, by = 'project.num') %>% 
  inner_join(project_io, by = 'project.num') %>% 
  select(activity, rcr, total.cost) %>% 
  group_by(activity) %>% 
  do(tidy(cor(.$rcr, .$total.cost, use = "complete"))) %>%
  rename(Grant.Type=activity, rcr_total.cost_cor=x)
```

## Problem 6 (extra extra credit)

Use [`gganimate`](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate) to illustrate the change in cost of R01s for a few institutes over time.

```{r extra_extra_credit, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
projects %>% 
  left_join(project_io, by = 'project.num') %>% 
  filter(activity == 'R01') %>% 
  select(institute, fiscal.year, fy.cost, n.pubs) %>% 
  group_by(institute, fiscal.year) %>% 
  slice(1:3) %>% 
  distinct(fiscal.year, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n.pubs, fy.cost, color = institute, frame = fiscal.year)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = 'Annual Publications',
       y = 'Annual Cost',
       color = 'Institute')-> p

gganimate(p, 'output.gif')
```
